In every case, the answer is No. The terms of service contracts (TOS) that govern digital media almost never convey any of the rights listed above."}],"all_rights":[{"type":"text","value":"The correct answer, in every case, is No. You checked Yes for all statements, which seems to indicate that you believe you have similar rights to an ebook as you would have to a physical copy. In reality, the terms of service agreements (TOS) that govern digital media almost never convey any of the rights listed above."}],"example_right":[{"type":"text","value":"The correct answer, in every case, is No. However, like the vast majority of shoppers in the original survey, you answered that buying an ebook guarantees you certain rights. For example, you said that you would be able to %%DESC%%. In reality, the terms of service agreements (TOS) that govern digital media almost never convey any of the rights listed above."}],"transition":[{"type":"text","value":"The shoppers in Perzanowski and Hoofnagle's study consistently overestimated what rights they would acquire to the digital media they purchased. The vast majority believed that they would be able to keep their ebook indefinitely and transfer it to any device they own. More than a third believed they would be able to lend it or gift it to a friend."}],"no_own":[{"type":"text","value":"You did not check the box indicating you would \"own\" the ebook, which makes you either unusually knowledgeable or unusually cynical about this issue. In the study, 86% of respondents believed they owned an ebook they purchased online. This is an intuitive conclusion: When you pay for something, you expect to own it. However, in the case of digital media, it is clearly false. Most TOS contracts explicitly state that content is \"licensed, not sold\" and thus remains the property of the seller."}],"yes_own":[{"type":"text","value":"Like most survey respondents, you checked the box indicating that you would \"own\" the ebook. In the study, 86% of respondents agreed with you. This is an intuitive conclusion. When you buy something, you expect to own it. However, in the case of digital media, it is clearly false. Most TOS contracts explicitly state that content is \"licensed, not sold\" and thus remains the property of the seller."}]}
